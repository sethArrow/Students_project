<p><a style="color: #000066;" href="javascript:history.go(-1)">Back</a></p>

<p>The Bromkamp Foundation Scholarships for Economic Management Programmes at UG was instituted by Dr. Joachim Bromkamp who was the Honorary Consul of 
Ghana at the Stifterverband in Germany. In 2003 the foundation set up an endowment specifically to provide MPhil scholarships to high performing MPhil 
students in specific disciplines at the University of Ghana. The scholarship currently targets MPhil (Year 1) students in the departments of Agricultural 
Economics and Agribusiness (School of Agriculture); Economics (Faculty of Social Sciences), Finance (Business School) and Accounting (Business School).</p>
<p>The scholarship is awarded to high performing graduate students who have indicated the commitment to pursue an academic career with the University of Ghana. 
The award has a current value of $USD 2000 per academic year and is tenable at the University of Ghana for two years.</p>
<h4 style="color: #000066;">Selection Process</h4>
<p>A call for nominations is made each academic year and Heads of the specific departments in consultation with other faculty members select 2 to 3 MPhil 
students who meet all the eligibility criteria for the awards for consideration for the award. The selection of the nominees is done by interview with a 
Panel that comprises representatives of the nominee's department, representatives of the appropriate Faculty Deans, members of the Board of Graduate Studies 
and representatives from the Bromkamp Endowment.</p>
<p>The final awards are confirmed by the Bromkamp Endowment in Germany.</p>

			<h3>Research Topic: Internal Audit Quality and Earnings Management</h3>
			<h4>Research Summary:</h4>
			<p>Various researchers have examined a lot of issues concerning earnings management in recent times especially 
			after the recent financial scandals around the world such as the Enron and WorldCom scandals (Healy and Wahlen 
			1999, Davidson et. al 2005 Prawitt et. al 2008).</p>
			<p>The basic objective of financial statements is the provision of information about the financial strength, 
			performance and changes in financial position of an enterprise that is useful to a wide range of users in 
			making economic decisions (IASC, 1989, paragraph 12) but there exist biases in the preparation of these 
			financial statements due to choice of accounting policies.</p>
			<p>Earnings management (EM) to SEC (1999, final rule) as cited in Davidson et al (2005) is the practice of 
			distorting the true financial performance of a company. To Clikeman et al (2001) earnings management is 
			the practice of making discretionary accounting choices or timing operating decisions to move reported 
			earnings toward a desired goal. Healy and Wahlen (1999) adds that EM occurs when managers use judgement 
			in financial reporting and in structuring transactions to alter financial reporting to mislead some 
			stakeholders about the underlying economic outcomes that depends on reported accounting numbers.</p>
			<p>Research has shown that management's forecasts are more biased when it is relatively difficult to detect 
			misrepresentation (Rogers and Stocken 2005). To Scott and Pitman (2009), the GAAP accrual accounting system 
			requires managers to make numerous accounting judgments that have a profound impact on reported earnings. 
			With such possible judgements, there is the likelihood for managers to manage reported earnings to achieve 
			their own goals, hence the need for auditors. Kim et al (2003), assert that, high quality auditors are more 
			likely to restrict earnings management. Internal Audit Function (IAF) play an incremental role in the quality 
			of work by external auditors. With this corporate governance (CG) in recent years has focused its attention to 
			the role of maintaining transparency and accountability of financial reporting (Al-Shetwi et al, 2011), 
			resulting in new acts of CG to improve financial reporting quality (Cohen et al., 2008). This brought the 
			introduction of internal audit as one of the four cornerstones of CG (Gramling et al., 2004; Prawitt et al., 2009). 
			The IAF is considered an effective function in governance structure, providing an important role in assessing internal 
			control effectiveness and also on the quality of financial reporting. With this, we seek to investigate and submit a 
			report on the impact IAF quality on earnings management in the case of Ghana.</p>
			<h4>Objectives of the Study</h4>
			<p>The research seeks to determine the level of quality of IAF in Ghanaian listed firms. In addition to find out the 
			extent of earnings management in our listed companies and also to identify the motivating factors of EM in Ghana if any. 
			Finally, the study seeks to find out the impact IAF quality has on earnings management in the case of Ghanaian listed non 
			financial institutions.</p>
			<h4>Scope</h4>
			<p>The research is limited to companies listed on the GSE from 2006 to 2010 and further to listed non financial firms on the GSE.</p>
			<h4>Methodology</h4>
			<p>A composite measure would be used in measuring IAF quality, which would then be correlated with EM (proxy by discretionary accrual). 
			In the formulation of IAF components, Prawitt et al (2008) components of the IAF quality is adopted, which is also a measure used 
			by the external auditing standards for external auditors to measure the quality of IAF (AICPA 1997). Both primary and secondary data 
			would be used in this study.</p>

		<h3>Research Topic: Risk Reporting: A Study of Risk Disclosures in the Annual Reports of Firms in Ghana</h3>
		<h4>Research Summary:</h4>
		<p>Organisations use their annual report as the major means of communicating about their value to shareholders and stakeholders. According 
		to Gray et al. (1995) annual reports serve as the official and legal means by which organisations regularly communicate with its stakeholders. 
		The annual report of organisations contains both the traditional financial statements and non-financial information. In the preparation of 
		financial statements, accountants consider the decision needs of the users of financial statements in order to present information that is 
		useful (Scott, 2003). Scott (2003) further explains that the rational risk-averse investor is interested in the riskiness of the firm in 
		making his economic buy or sell decision. Investors need to understand the risks a company takes to create value and they want to have information 
		on the sustainability of current value-creation strategies (Beretta and Bozzolan, 2004). Hence the disclosure of the various types of risk faced by 
		firms has become important. This concept of risk and its management has attracted attention lately however in depth research into this area is lacking 
		(Linsley and Shrives, 2006). Moreover, most research in risk disclosure is in developed countries (Linsley & Shrives (2006), Beretta & Bozzolan (2004), 
		Lajili & Zeghal (2005)). In Ghana, literature on the disclosure of risk by firms is scarce. This study intends to close this gap in literature. Also, 
		while most of the research used single years, this study will use a longitudinal approach in order to observe trends in the enhancement of risk disclosures.
		</p>
		<h4>Objectives</h4>
		<p>The Study will seek to achieve the following specific objectives;
		<ul>
			<li>To identify the nature and types of risk disclosed by listed firms </li>
			<li>To determine the location of risk disclosure in the annual report of listed firms</li>
			<li>To examine the trends in risk disclosure over the years</li>
			<li>To identify the relationship between the number of risk disclosures and firm characteristics</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h4>Scope</h4>
		<p>This study will be limited to listed firms on the Ghana stock exchange between 2006 and 2010. Irrespective of the subjective nature of the content 
		analysis methodology, which may affect the results of the study, it is the most widely used methodology in research for examining disclosures. In 
		order to draw valid conclusions using content analysis, the coding method will have to be reliable (Linsley and Shrives, 2006).
		</p>
		<h4>Methodology</h4>
		<p>The annual reports of listed firms between 2006 and 2010 will be carefully analysed to identify statements of risk disclosures for each year. 
		Observations can then be made to identify any trends. A regression will then be used to test the relationship between the number of disclosures and 
		firm characteristics such as size, age, leverage and auditor type.

			<h3>Research Topic: The Effects of Off-farm Income on Food Security in Northern Ghana.</h3>
			<h4>Research Summary:</h4>
			<p>Food security involves the availability, accessibility and affordability of food to all is of major concern to most economies. 
			Food insecurity is still of major concern in many countries, most especially in developing countries. In Ghana, about 5% of the 
			population is food insecure, with the northern regions recording higher proportions (WFP, 2009). In places where economic growth 
			has recently improved, it has reduced poverty. But it is only where agricultural growth has also increased that hunger has being 
			reduced. The major challenge to food security in Africa is its underdeveloped agricultural sector that is characterized by 
			over-reliance on primary agriculture, low fertility soils, environmental degradation, post- harvest losses, minimal value addition 
			and product differentiation, and inadequate food storage and preservation that result in significant commodity price 
			fluctuation(Mwaniki,2004).Off-farm activities from which the farmer earn income apart from their farm work include agriculture wage 
			jobs on other people's farm, non-agriculture wage-employment or self-employment in commerce, mining, manufacturing, construction, 
			transport and service sector. Off-farm income activities could increase household income; however, it could also create competition 
			for household labour between farm and off-farm activities. This therefore, raises the following research questions: What proportion 
			of income is generated from farm and off-farm activities? What factors determine farmers' participation in off-farm activities? What 
			off-farm activities affect food insecurity status of farming households in the study area?
			</p>
			<p>The main objective of the study is to assess the effect of off-farm income on food security. The specific objectives are to:
			<ol>
				<li>Determine the proportion of income from farm and off-farm activities.</li>
				<li>Analyse the factors that influence participation in off-farm activities.</li>
				<li>Examine the influence of off-farm activities on food Security status of farming households.</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
			<h4>Methodology</h4>
			<p>Descriptive statistics, producing summary statistics of means, frequencies and percentages, differentiating with and without 
			off-farm household income would be used. Also, the logic regression models would be used to estimate the factors. The study 
			would be conducted in the Northern Regions of Ghana from 350 households.

			<h3>Research Topic: Farmers Health Poverty and Agricultural Productivity in Rural Ghana</h3>
			<h4>Research Summary:</h4>
			<p>Mortality rate is rising as a result of Health impediments. It disrupts the economic and social foundations of families hence 
			having a detrimental impact on rural households' productive capacity. As pointed by the World Bank (2007), illness and death 
			from HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other diseases reduce agricultural productivity through the loss of labour, knowledge 
			of productive adults, and assets to cope with illness. For Lipton and de kadt (1988), the lack of coordination of policymaking 
			between agriculture and health undermines effort to overcome ill health among the rural poor and gives short shrift to agriculture's 
			role in alleviating many of the world's most serious problems. Ghana is no exception, especially those in rural areas and therefore 
			the need for urgent measures to improve health impediment issues in rural Ghana.The research questions are; What are the cropping 
			patterns and the effect of health impediments on them? What are the effects of health impediments on output and incomes of farmers? 
			What is the impact of health impediments on agricultural technical efficiency of farmers?
			The main objective of this research is to access the impact of health impediments on the technical efficiency of farms in rural Ghana.
			</p>
			<p>The specific objectives are to:
				<ol>
					<li>Analyse the cropping patterns in the study area and the changes which have occurred due to health impediments.</li>
					<li>Carry out a comparative analysis of the outputs and incomes of farms households with and without health impediments.</li>
					<li>Evaluate the comparative technical efficiencies of farms owned by households with and without health impediments.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<h4>Scope and Proposed Methodology</h4>
			<p>The study will be conducted in the Volta region of Ghana where about 60% of the people are involved in agriculture. The crops 
			mainly grown are cocoa, oil palm, coffee, rice, yam, cassava, banana, plantain, maize and some vegetables. The multistage sampling 
			using the approach of Barnett and Blaike (1992) will be employed in this study.
			Primary data will be collected from about 300 farmers with the aid of well structured questionnaires. Descriptive statistics 
			will be used for objective one, budgetary analysis for objective two and the production frontier function for objective three. 
			This model was developed by Joudrow et al (1982) and previously applied in similar analysis by Seyoun et al (1998) and Adoeti (2001).

			<h3>Research Topic: Corporate Environmental Reporting and Disclosure Practices</h3>
			<h4>Research Summary:</h4>
			<p>In recent years the issue of corporate social and environmental reporting has received many concerns from researchers. Issues 
			regarding corporate environmental reporting and disclosures have received a great deal of attention by the researchers 
			(Gray et al,1996;Azzone et al, 1996; Margolis and Walsh, 2003; Islam,2002; Islam and Deegan,2008;Deegan and Gordon,1996; Gamble,1995; 
			Mathews,1997; Milne and Patten,2002; Belal,1999;Guthrie and Parker,1990).
			</p>
			<p>Very few studies have been done on environmental disclosures in the developing and newly industrialized countries. Though there 
			have been attempts to examine social reporting as a whole in Ghana, most companies in Ghana, to date, have not specifically published, 
			environmental information in their annual reports. It is evidenced in Islam (2002) study that only 6% publicly traded companies made 
			environmental disclosure. It is against this background that this research seeks to conduct an empirical study on environmental reporting 
			and disclosure practices and the nature of Corporate Environmental Reporting in Ghana.
			</p>
			<h4>Objectives of the Study</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>To determine the Environmental Reporting requirements in Ghana.</li>
				<li>To assess the level of compliance of environmental laws in Ghana.</li>
				<li>To identify the factors that motivates management to disclose environmentally related information in annual reports in Ghana.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Methodology</h4>
			<p>The research study would adopt an integration of theoretical framework, financial and statistical analysis. This type of research would 
			involve the collection of data, for which both primary and secondary data will be utilized.
			</p>
			<p>The primary data collection involves the use of questionnaires and personal interviews, and these will be designed for selected companies 
			from a targeted population. The secondary data collection involves the use of audited financial reports of the selected companies, periodic 
			reports on Ministry of Environment, Mines and Energy, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Forestry Commission and other relevant information 
			that are needed for the study.
			</p>
			<h4>Scope</h4>
			<p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate and assess the extent of corporate environmental reporting and disclosure practices of companies in 
			Ghana. The research will concentrate especially on companies in the following industries: mining, energy, manufacturing, lumbering, Oil 
			extraction and the telecommunication. This is because these companies' activities directly or indirectly have tremendous effect on the environment. 
			The selection of the companies will be .chosen from a targeted population. The targeted population will be companies listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange.
